# Elements

## Indoor

* What does the floor feel like? Is it hard? Does it make sounds (what
  sounds) when you step on it? Is it cold?
* What do the walls feel like? What's their texture? Are they hard? Are they
  cold?

* Choose a sharp edge in the room and touch it. What does it feel like?

* Look at the room facing the windows
* Look at the room so that you do not see any windows
* Walk diagonally from one corner to the other, then turn and observe the
  space you've just traversed

* Come to the room 6 hours later and restart the perception routine.
