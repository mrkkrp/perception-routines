Perception routines

A perception routine is a sequence of directives. Each directive is
represented by a letter of the Latin alphabet. The goal with this form of
representation is to be able to memorize a routine as a phrase with
quasi-English phonemes and follow it from memory without looking anything
up.

Following a perception routine should start by making sure there are no
distractions around (no carrier reality, no people, no pets, etc.), only raw
reality.

The very first directive is implicit and therefore it is not encoded in the
printed phrases. It consists of paying attention to the environment and
exploring it freely according to whatever naturally attracts one's
attention. Only when this initial impulse is satisfied should one start with
the printed letters and the corresponding directives.

Attention is crucial for perception routines. This, however, does not mean
that one cannot deviate from the given directives. In fact, the directives
are only suggestions, not rules. They can be overlapped in time, skipped,
paused and resumed. The only condition is that one is paying attention to
raw reality at all times and stays concentrated. Unrelated thoughts are to
be avoided.

Some directives will assume an object. The choice of the object is yours. If
you have an obvious predilection, go for it. Otherwise choose randomly.
Choose things you do not necessarily pay attention to in everyday life.

The following directives are defined:
