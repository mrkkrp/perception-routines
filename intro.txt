Perception routines

A perception routine is a sequence of directives and the activity of
carrying them out. Each directive is represented by a letter of the Latin
alphabet. The goal with this form of representation is to make it easy to
memorize a perception routine as a 5-letter word (a ‘pentad’) made up of
quasi-English syllables.

Attention is crucial for perception routines. This, however, does not mean
that one cannot deviate from the given directives. In fact, the directives
in a perception routine are meant to be a collection of possibilities or
suggestions that can be explored in arbitrary order so as to construct a
perceptual narrative that is meaningful for the subject. They can be
overlapped in time, skipped, paused and resumed. The only condition is that
one is paying attention to reality and stays concentrated.

Some directives will assume an object/area/surface. The choice is yours. If
you have an obvious predilection, go for it. Otherwise choose randomly.
Choose things you do not necessarily pay attention to in everyday life. Feel
free to repeat this kind of action with different objects/areas/surfaces.

The so-called perception routine pentads that this application generates are
only the first step of the journey. They are meant to be helpful in learning
the vocabulary of how reality can be perceived in a way that is aligned with
the real realist intention. Once learned, this vocabulary can and should be
practiced naturally as part of everyday life. At that point pentads are no
longer very important, except for occasions when the individual feels like
they need inspiration or external guidance.

The following directives are defined:
