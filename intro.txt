Perception routines

A perception routine is a sequence of directives and the action of carrying
them out. Each directive is represented by a letter of the Latin alphabet.
The goal with this form of representation is to make it easy to memorize a
perception routine as a phrase made up of quasi-English syllables and to
follow it from memory without looking anything up.

Before you start following a perception routine, make sure that there are no
distractions around. The very first directive is implicit and therefore it
is not encoded in the printed phrases. It consists of exploring the
environment freely according to whatever naturally attracts your attention.
Only when this initial impulse has been satisfied should you start with the
printed letters and the corresponding directives.

Attention is crucial for perception routines. This, however, does not mean
that one cannot deviate from the given directives. In fact, the directives
are only suggestions, not rules. They can be overlapped in time, skipped,
paused and resumed. The only condition is that one is paying attention to
reality at all times and stays concentrated. Unrelated thoughts are to be
avoided.

Some directives will assume an object/area/surface. The choice is yours. If
you have an obvious predilection, go for it. Otherwise choose randomly.
