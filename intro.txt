represented by a letter of the Latin alphabet. The goal with this form of
representation is to make it easy to memorize a perception routine as a
5-letter word (a pentad) made up of quasi-English syllables.

It is up to the individual to choose when to employ a perceptual tactic from
the routine. However, one should try to stick to the tactics of a given
routine without mixing in other perceptual tactics one might know.
